They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, <br/>

## Acts 28:26-27 (NIV) (p.3/4)
“ ‘Go to this people and say, <br/>
“You will be ever hearing but never understanding; <br/>

For this people’s heart has become calloused; <br/>
they hardly hear with their ears, <br/>
and they have closed their eyes.

Otherwise they might see with their eyes, <br/>
hear with their ears, understand with their hearts <br/>
and turn, and I would heal them.’ ...

---

## Acts 28:28-31 (NIV) (p.4/4)
“Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation <br/>
has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”

For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own <br/>
rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.

He proclaimed the kingdom of God <br/>
and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ -- <br/>
with all boldness and without hindrance!

## Ac28: The Fragrant Gospel
1. Paul's heart: **Persuasion**
  <span class="hl1">(v23)</span>
2. Hearers' response: **Partition**
  <span class="hl1">(v24-25)</span>
3. Holy Spirit's prophecy: **Promise**
  <span class="hl1">(v26-27)</span>
4. Paul's lifestyle: **Proclamation**
  <span class="hl1">(v28-31)</span>

>>>
+ How did Paul **continue** after this **disappointing** response?

## 4. Proclamation: 28-31 (NIV)
“Therefore I want you to know that **God’s salvation** <br/>
has been sent to the **Gentiles**, and they will **listen**!”

For **two whole years** Paul stayed there in his own <br/>
rented house and **welcomed** all who came to see him.

He **proclaimed** the kingdom of God <br/>
and **taught** about the Lord Jesus Christ -- <br/>
with all **boldness** and without hindrance!

>>>
+ To **Gentiles**
  + (13:46-47 Pisidian Antioch)
+ **stayed** + welcomed:
  + own rent: **tentmaking**, 2Co8-9
+ Acts ends seemingly **abruptly**:
  + What about Paul's **trial**?
  + Appeal to **Caesar**?
  + Accusations by Jeru **Jews**?

## 2 Corinthians 2:14-16 (ESV)

Thanks be to God, who in Christ
always leads us in **triumphal procession**,
and through us spreads the **fragrance**
of the **knowledge of Him** everywhere.

For we are the **aroma of Christ** to God <br/>
among those who are being **saved** <br/>
and among those who are **perishing**,

to one a fragrance **from death to death**, <br/>
to the other a fragrance **from life to life**.

>>>
+ **everywh**: Troas to Macedonia
  + skipped Corinth
+ from **life** to life:
  + **rebuke** -> godly **sorrow** -> **repentance**
+ from **death** to death:
  + hearts **veiled** read Law
+ **turn** to Lord -> veil **lifted**
