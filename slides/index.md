1. The **Persuasion** of the Gospel
  <span style="color:#1b91ff">(v23)</span>

4. The **Proclamation** of the Gospel
  <span style="color:#1b91ff">(v28-31)</span>

>>>
1. Jews || churched: "good guys"
  + OT bg, expectant hope for God's rescue (:20)
  + Paul loved Israel deeply (Ro9:1-3)
2. cause divisions, reveal hearts
  + not to bring peace, but a sword
  + Ro7 law reveals sin
3. hardened -> dulled -> blurred
  + see -> hear -> understand -> turn
  + Ro9 not as though Word failed
4. move on but never give up hope
  + despite physical limitations: house arrest, not seen by Caesar
  + stayed + welcomed
    + own rent: tentmaking, 2Co8-9

## Acts 28:23 (p.1/4)
They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, <br/>
and came in even larger numbers <br/>
to the place where he was staying.

He witnessed to them from morning till evening, <br/>
explaining about the kingdom of God, <br/>
and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets <br/>
he tried to persuade them about Jesus.

## Acts 28:24-25 (p.2/4)
Some were convinced by what he said, <br/>
but others would not believe.

They disagreed among themselves and began to leave <br/>
after Paul had made this final statement:

“The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors <br/>
when he said through Isaiah the prophet:

## Acts 28:26-27 (p.3/4)
“ ‘Go to this people and say, <br/>
“You will be ever hearing but never understanding; <br/>
you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”

For this people’s heart has become calloused; <br/>
they hardly hear with their ears, <br/>
and they have closed their eyes.

Otherwise they might see with their eyes, <br/>
hear with their ears, understand with their hearts <br/>
and turn, and I would heal them.’

---

## Acts 28:28-31 (p.4/4)
“Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation <br/>
has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”

For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own <br/>
rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.

He proclaimed the kingdom of God <br/>
and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ -- <br/>
with all boldness and without hindrance!
