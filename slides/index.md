## Acts 28:23 (NIV) (p.1/4)
They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, <br/>
and came in even larger numbers <br/>
to the place where he was staying.

He witnessed to them from morning till evening, <br/>
explaining about the kingdom of God, <br/>
and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets <br/>
he tried to persuade them about Jesus.

---

## Acts 28:24-25 (NIV) (p.2/4)
Some were convinced by what he said, <br/>
but others would not believe.

They disagreed among themselves and began to leave <br/>
after Paul had made this final statement:

“The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors <br/>
when he said through Isaiah the prophet:

---

## Acts 28:26-27 (NIV) (p.3/4)
“ ‘Go to this people and say, <br/>
“You will be ever hearing but never understanding; <br/>
you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”

For this people’s heart has become calloused; <br/>
they hardly hear with their ears, <br/>
and they have closed their eyes.

Otherwise they might see with their eyes, <br/>
hear with their ears, understand with their hearts <br/>
and turn, and I would heal them.’

---

## Acts 28:28-31 (NIV) (p.4/4)
“Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation <br/>
has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”

For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own <br/>
rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.

He proclaimed the kingdom of God <br/>
and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ -- <br/>
with all boldness and without hindrance!

## Acts 28:23 (NIV)
They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, <br/>
and came in even larger numbers <br/>
to the place where he was staying.

He **witnessed** to them from morning till evening, <br/>
**explaining** about the **kingdom of God**, <br/>
and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets <br/>
he tried to **persuade** them about **Jesus**.

>>>
+ witness (lay out): put forth, exposition
+ explaining (martyr): witness, testify
  + from memory, kept in mind
  + focus not on us but on God's kingship
  + kingdom of God: is near (John, Jesus)
+ persuade (faith, belief, trust): convince, win over, coax, seduce
  + Jewish audience: OT bg, hope of Messiah
  + cf (14:19) Jews "won over" crowds
  + cf (1Co2:4) not by persuasive wisdom
+ concerning Jesus, from Moses/Prophets
  + Connect up OT Messiah with Jesus
  + fulfil hope, not attack (:20)

## Acts 17:22-24 (NASB)

“Men of Athens, I observe that <br/>
you are **very religious** in all respects. <br/>
For while I was passing through and <br/>
examining the objects of your worship, <br/>
I also found an altar with this inscription, <br/>
‘TO AN **UNKNOWN GOD**.’

Therefore **what you worship** in ignorance, <br/>
**this I proclaim** to you."

  + church-goers who don't live like Christians?
  + believers in "God" but not Jesus
  + want God's rescue but not Kingship
    + kingdom of God

## Acts 28:24-25 (NIV)
Some were **convinced** by what he said, <br/>

## Luke 2:34-35 (ESV)

Behold, this child is appointed for <br/>
the **fall** and **rising** of many in Israel,

and for a **sign** that is **opposed** -- <br/>
and a **sword** will pierce through your own **soul** also --

so that **thoughts** from many hearts may be **revealed**.

---

## Matthew 10:34,37-38 (NIV)

Do not suppose that I have come to bring **peace** to the earth. <br/>
I did not come to bring peace, but a **sword**.

“Anyone who loves their **father or mother** <br/>
more than me is not worthy of me; <br/>
anyone who loves their **son or daughter** <br/>
more than me is not worthy of me.

Whoever does not take up their **cross** <br/>
and **follow me** is not worthy of me.

## Romans 7:7-8 (NIV) (p1/2)

I would not have **known** what sin was <br/>
had it not been for the **law**. <br/>
For I would not have known what **coveting** really was <br/>
if the law had not said, “**You shall not covet**.”

But **sin**, seizing the **opportunity** <br/>
afforded by the commandment, <br/>
produced in me every kind of coveting.

---

## Romans 7:13 (NIV) (p2/2)

In order that sin might be **recognized as sin**, <br/>
it used what is **good** to bring about **my death**, <br/>
so that through the commandment

**sin** might become **utterly sinful**.
