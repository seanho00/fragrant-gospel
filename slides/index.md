## Acts 28:23 (NIV) (p.1/4)
They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, <br/>
and came in even larger numbers <br/>
to the place where he was staying.

He witnessed to them from morning till evening, <br/>
explaining about the kingdom of God, <br/>
and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets <br/>
he tried to persuade them about Jesus. ...

>>>
Now we come to today's passage.
Let's read it together, 4 slides.

---

## Acts 28:24-25 (NIV) (p.2/4)
Some were convinced by what he said, <br/>
but others would not believe.

They disagreed among themselves and began to leave <br/>
after Paul had made this final statement:

“The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors <br/>
when he said through Isaiah the prophet: ...

---

## Acts 28:26-27 (NIV) (p.3/4)
“ ‘Go to this people and say, <br/>
“You will be ever hearing but never understanding; <br/>
you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”

For this people’s heart has become calloused; <br/>
they hardly hear with their ears, <br/>
and they have closed their eyes.

Otherwise they might see with their eyes, <br/>
hear with their ears, understand with their hearts <br/>
and turn, and I would heal them.’ ...

---

## Acts 28:28-31 (NIV) (p.4/4)
“Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation <br/>
has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”

For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own <br/>
rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.

He proclaimed the kingdom of God <br/>
and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ -- <br/>
with all boldness and without hindrance!

>>>
+ "But that was **Paul**, apostle, writer of NT, etc."
  + "I can't preach gospel like that, I'm not a missionary"
+ narrative: **exemplary**, not **exhaustive**
  + Other NT narratives show diff methods
+ (not: "descriptive, not prescriptive")
  + not just a nice **story** that doesn't apply to us!

---

## Philippians 3:17 (NASB)
Brethren, **join** in following my **example**, <br/>
and **observe** those who walk <br/>
according to the **pattern** you have in us.

>>>
+ But that doesn't mean examples don't matter!
  + **Totality** of Biblical examples, common threads
  + Describe the **pattern** for us to follow
+ Ultimate example is Christ
  + (1Cor11:1 follow me as I follow Christ)

## Ac28: The Fragrant Gospel
1. Paul's exposition: **Persuasion**
  <span class="hl1">(v23)</span>
2. Hearers' response: **Partition**
  <span class="hl1">(v24-25)</span>
3. Holy Spirit's prophecy: **Promise**
  <span class="hl1">(v26-28)</span>
4. Paul's lifestyle: **Proclamation**
  <span class="hl1">(v30-31)</span>

>>>
+ Concentric **circles** starting from v17:
  + Jewish leaders -> Roman Jews -> Gentiles
+ Paul **lays out** the gospel of Jesus Messiah
+ The hearers are **split** in two in their response
+ Paul **quotes** an OT prophecy via Isaiah
+ Paul **continues** for 2yrs in house arrest

---

## Paul and the Jews

[img: Paul preaching]

>>>
+ First, some **bg** on Paul's history with the Jews
+ Jews **persecuted** him all along journeys
  + Accusers in **Jeru** prob from Asia Minor
+ So what does **Paul** himself say about the Jews?
  + Hate? Give up / hopeless?  Avoid?
+ To understand Paul's **heart** for the Jews, cf Rom9-11

---

## Romans 9:2-3 (NIV) (p.1/2)
I have great **sorrow** and unceasing **anguish** in my heart.

For I could wish that I myself <br/>
were **cursed** and **cut off** from Christ

for the sake of **my people**, those of **my own race**, <br/>
the people of **Israel**. ...

>>>
+ Not as **enemies** but as **countrymen**!
  + no anti-Semitism here
+ Paul **loved** Israel deeply
+ What's more, he valued their unique **background**:

---

## Romans 9:4 (NIV) (p.2/2)
Theirs is the **adoption** to sonship; <br/>
theirs the divine **glory**, the **covenants**, <br/>
the receiving of the **law**, <br/>
the temple **worship** and the **promises**.

>>>
+ **Blessed** by God, **chosen**, had **Word**
  + Cling to OT **worship** and **promises**
  + **Hope** expectantly for God's **rescue**
+ The "**good guys**", not the villains!
  + **Pious**, moral, desire to be good
+ Also, Claudius **expelled** Roman Jews for unrest (18:2)
  + Roman Jews also **sizing up** Paul
  + Is Paul's **motive** to cause unrest?
+ Keep context in mind as we re-read today's passage:

---

## 1. Persuasion: v23 (NIV)

He **witnessed** to them from morning till evening, <br/>
**explaining** about the **kingdom of God**, <br/>
and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets <br/>
he tried to **persuade** them about **Jesus**.

>>>
+ NIV ought to have **swapped** first 2 verbs
+ witness (**lay out**): put forth, exposition
  + Jews **wanted** to hear his thinking
  + Get to the **main point** clearly
+ explaining (martyr): **witness**, testify

---

[img: witness]

>>>
+ from memory, kept in **mind**
+ **focus** not on witness but on what he saw
+ not on us but on **God's kingship**

## 1. Persuasion: v23 (NIV)

He witnessed to them from morning till evening, <br/>
**explaining** about the **kingdom of God**, <br/>
and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets <br/>
he tried to **persuade** them about Jesus.

>>>
+ bear witness to the authority of God
+ **kingdom of God**: is near (John, Jesus)
+ **persuade** (faith, belief, trust):
  + convince, win over, coax, seduce
+ wait, "seduce" **doesn't** sound good!
  + cf (14:19) Jews "**won over**" crowds
  + in fact...

---

## 1 Corinthians 2:4-5 (NASB)
My **message** and my **preaching**

were not in **persuasive** words of wisdom, <br/>
but in demonstration of the **Spirit** and of **power**,

so that your **faith** would not rest <br/>
on the **wisdom of men**, but on the **power of God**.

>>>
+ **What** is persuasive?
  + My **eloquence** / cleverness / cultural relevance?
  + Holy **Spirit** and **power** of God
+ Remember, "persuasive" == "faith"
  + What does my **faith** rest on?
  + == what do I find **persuasive**?
+ Don't want **disciples** of my personality but of Christ

## 1. Persuasion: v23 (NIV)

He witnessed to them from morning till evening, <br/>
explaining about the kingdom of God, <br/>
and from the **Law of Moses** and from the **Prophets** <br/>
he tried to persuade them about **Jesus**.

>>>
+ **Jewish audience**: OT bg, hope of Messiah
  + "taught": at end of passage, to Gentiles
+ concerning **Jesus**, from Moses/Prophets
  + Connect up OT **Messiah** with Jesus
+ Still **contentious** for most Jews today
  + **fulfill** hope, not attack (:20)
+ Different approach to those **w/o** OT bg:

---

## Acts 17:22-24 (NASB)

“Men of **Athens**, I observe that <br/>
you are **very religious** in all respects.

For while I was passing through and <br/>
examining the objects of your worship, <br/>
I also found an altar with this inscription, <br/>
‘TO AN **UNKNOWN GOD**.’

Therefore **what you worship** in ignorance, <br/>
**this I proclaim** to you."

  + Fill void with many other pursuits

## Luke 2:34-35 (ESV)

Behold, this child is appointed for <br/>
the **fall** and **rising** of many in Israel,

and for a **sign** that is **opposed** -- <br/>
and a **sword** will pierce through your own **soul** also --

so that **thoughts** from many hearts may be **revealed**.

---

## Matthew 10:34,37-38 (NIV)

Do not suppose that I have come to bring **peace** to the earth. <br/>
I did not come to bring peace, but a **sword**.

“Anyone who loves their **father or mother** <br/>
more than me is not worthy of me; <br/>
anyone who loves their **son or daughter** <br/>
more than me is not worthy of me.

Whoever does not take up their **cross** <br/>
and **follow me** is not worthy of me.

## Romans 7:7-8 (NIV) (p1/2)

I would not have **known** what sin was <br/>
had it not been for the **law**. <br/>
For I would not have known what **coveting** really was <br/>
if the law had not said, “**You shall not covet**.”

But **sin**, seizing the **opportunity** <br/>
afforded by the commandment, <br/>
produced in me every kind of coveting.

---

## Romans 7:13 (NIV) (p2/2)

In order that sin might be **recognized as sin**, <br/>
it used what is **good** to bring about **my death**, <br/>
so that through the commandment

**sin** might become **utterly sinful**.
