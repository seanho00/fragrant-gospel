They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, <br/>
and came in even larger numbers <br/>

He witnessed to them from morning till evening, <br/>
explaining about the kingdom of God, <br/>

## Acts 28:24-25 (NIV) (p.2/4)
Some were convinced by what he said, <br/>
but others would not believe.

They disagreed among themselves and began to leave <br/>
after Paul had made this final statement:

“The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors <br/>
when he said through Isaiah the prophet: ...

## Acts 28:26-27 (NIV) (p.3/4)
“ ‘Go to this people and say, <br/>
“You will be ever hearing but never understanding; <br/>
you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”

For this people’s heart has become calloused; <br/>
they hardly hear with their ears, <br/>
and they have closed their eyes.

Otherwise they might see with their eyes, <br/>
hear with their ears, understand with their hearts <br/>
and turn, and I would heal them.’ ...

---

## Acts 28:28-31 (NIV) (p.4/4)
“Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation <br/>
has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”

For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own <br/>
rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.

He proclaimed the kingdom of God <br/>
and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ -- <br/>
with all boldness and without hindrance!

## 2 Corinthians 2:14-16 (ESV)

Thanks be to God, who in Christ
always leads us in **triumphal procession**,
and through us spreads the **fragrance**
of the **knowledge of Him** everywhere.

For we are the **aroma of Christ** to God <br/>
among those who are being **saved** <br/>
and among those who are **perishing**,

to one a fragrance **from death to death**, <br/>
to the other a fragrance **from life to life**.

>>>
+ from **life** to life:
  + 1Cor **rebuke** caused godly **sorrow** -> **repentance**
+ from **death** to death:
  + hearts **veiled** when read Law
+ but **turn** to Lord -> veil **removed**

# Do I exude the **fragrance of Christ** <br/> in my daily life?

>>>
+ doesn't mean being a **nice guy**, moral, charity!
+ to the contrary, ack own **unworthiness**
  + universal need for **redemption**
+ be a **smelly** Christian:
  + stench of death to **sin**
  + aroma of **new life** in Christ
+ from **death to death**, from **life to life**

## Romans 7:7-8 (NIV) (p1/2)
I would not have **known** what sin was <br/>
had it not been for the **law**. <br/>
For I would not have known what **coveting** really was <br/>
if the law had not said, “**You shall not covet**.”

But **sin**, seizing the **opportunity** <br/>
afforded by the commandment, <br/>
produced in me every kind of coveting.

---

## Romans 7:13 (NIV) (p2/2)
In order that sin might be **recognized as sin**, <br/>
it used what is **good** to bring about **my death**, <br/>
so that through the commandment

**sin** might become **utterly sinful**.
