## Romans 7:7-8 (NIV) (p1/2)
I would not have **known** what sin was <br/>
had it not been for the **law**. <br/>
For I would not have known what **coveting** really was <br/>
if the law had not said, “**You shall not covet**.”

But **sin**, seizing the **opportunity** <br/>
afforded by the commandment, <br/>
produced in me every kind of coveting.

+ "Don't eat ice cream, it's bad for you"
+ -> think about ice cream, want it

## Romans 7:13 (NIV) (p2/2)
In order that sin might be **recognized as sin**, <br/>
it used what is **good** to bring about **my death**, <br/>
so that through the commandment

**sin** might become **utterly sinful**.

## Romans 9:6 (ESV)
But it is not as though <br/>
the word of God has **failed**.

For not all who are <br/>
**descended** from Israel <br/>
**belong** to Israel,

<!--
It is not the children of the **flesh** <br/>
who are the children of God, <br/>
but the **children of the promise** <br/>
are counted as offspring.
-->

>>>
+ if people don't **listen**,
  + not that gospel **failed**
  + or God is not **strong** enough to save

## Romans 11:1-2 (NIV)
Did God **reject** his people? By no means!

I am an Israelite myself,
a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew.

## Romans 11:21-22 (NIV)
So do not become **proud**, but **fear**.

For if God did not **spare** the natural branches,
neither will he spare you.

Note then the **kindness** and the **severity** of God:
severity toward those who have **fallen**,
but God's kindness to **you**,
provided you **continue** in his kindness.
