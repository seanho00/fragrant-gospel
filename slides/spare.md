## Romans 7:7-8 (NIV) (p1/2)
I would not have **known** what sin was <br/>
had it not been for the **law**. <br/>
For I would not have known what **coveting** really was <br/>
if the law had not said, “**You shall not covet**.”

But **sin**, seizing the **opportunity** <br/>
afforded by the commandment, <br/>
produced in me every kind of coveting.

## Romans 7:13 (NIV) (p2/2)
In order that sin might be **recognized as sin**, <br/>
it used what is **good** to bring about **my death**, <br/>
so that through the commandment

**sin** might become **utterly sinful**.
