## Romans 9:6 (ESV)
But it is not as though <br/>
the word of God has **failed**.

For not all who are <br/>
**descended** from Israel <br/>
**belong** to Israel,

<!--
It is not the children of the **flesh** <br/>
who are the children of God, <br/>
but the **children of the promise** <br/>
are counted as offspring.
-->

>>>
+ if people don't **listen**,
  + not that gospel **failed**
  + or God is not **strong** enough to save

## Romans 11:1-2 (NIV)
Did God **reject** his people? By no means!

I am an Israelite myself,
a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew.

>>>
+ Rock of stumbling: 1Pet2, Rom9/10, Is28:16

## Romans 11:21-22 (NIV)
So do not become **proud**, but **fear**.

For if God did not **spare** the natural branches,
neither will he spare you.

Note then the **kindness** and the **severity** of God:
severity toward those who have **fallen**,
but God's kindness to **you**,
provided you **continue** in his kindness.

>>>

---

## Romans 11:32 (NIV)
For God has bound everyone over to **disobedience** <br/>
so that he may have **mercy** on them all.

>>>
+ Not: "why **doesn't** God save them?"
+ But: "why **does** God save anybody?"
