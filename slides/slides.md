## Acts 28:23 <span class="ref">(NIV) (p.1/4)</span>
They arranged to **meet Paul** on a certain day, <br/>
and came in even **larger numbers** <br/>
to the place where he was staying.

He **witnessed** to them from morning till evening, <br/>
explaining about the **kingdom of God**, <br/>
and from the **Law** of Moses and from the **Prophets** <br/>
he tried to **persuade** them about Jesus. ...

---

## Acts 28:24-25 <span class="ref">(NIV) (p.2/4)</span>
Some were **convinced** by what he said, <br/>
but others **would not** believe.

They **disagreed** among themselves and began to leave <br/>
after Paul had made this final statement:

“The **Holy Spirit** spoke the truth to your ancestors <br/>
when he said through **Isaiah** the prophet: ...

---

## Acts 28:26-27 <span class="ref">(NIV) (p.3/4)</span>
“ ‘Go to this people and say, <br/>
“You will be ever **hearing** but never **understanding**; <br/>
you will be ever **seeing** but never **perceiving**.”

For this people’s **heart** has become calloused; <br/>
they hardly hear with their **ears**, <br/>
and they have closed their **eyes**.

Otherwise they might **see** with their eyes, <br/>
**hear** with their ears, **understand** with their hearts <br/>
and **turn**, and I would **heal** them.’ ...

---

## Acts 28:28-31 <span class="ref">(NIV) (p.4/4)</span>
“Therefore I want you to know that God’s **salvation** <br/>
has been sent to the **Gentiles**, and they will listen!”

For **two** whole years Paul stayed there in his own <br/>
rented house and **welcomed** all who came to see him.

He **proclaimed** the kingdom of God <br/>
and **taught** about the Lord Jesus Christ -- <br/>
with all **boldness** and without hindrance!

Then I said, “For **how long**, Lord?”

And he answered: <br/>
“Until the cities lie **ruined** <br/>
and without inhabitant, [...] <br/>
and the land is utterly **forsaken**.

[...] But as the terebinth and **oak** <br/>
leave **stumps** when they are cut down, <br/>

For **two whole years** Paul stayed there in his own <br/>

with all **boldness** and without hindrance!
